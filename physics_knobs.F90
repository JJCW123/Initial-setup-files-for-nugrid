   !     jbj mode is set in ppn_physics,input (see physics_knobs.F90 in the physics package)
   !     since JBJ16 rates cover the entire region of the isotopic chart that the Oda+ '94 rates cover, you can either:
   !        jbj_mode = 1 : don't use JBJ rates at all, just use Oda rates
   !        jbj_mode = 2 : use JBJ rates only where Oda rates are used, i.e. Oda rates are directly replaced
   !        jbj_mode = 3 : use full set of rates from Oda+ '94, and add remaining rates from JBJ where there is no overlap 
   !        jbj_mode = 4 : use JBJ rates everywhere provided, thus using none of the Oda rates (and extending beyond)
   integer, public :: jbj_mode

   !     NKK04 rate coverage overlaps with several other rate sources,
   !     so there are some options for how to merge the rates:
   !        nkk_mode = 1 : don't use NKK rates at all
   !        nkk_mode = 2 : use NKK rates only where LMP00 rates are available
   !        nkk_mode = 3 : use NKK rates when FFN, Oda94 and LMP are unavailable
